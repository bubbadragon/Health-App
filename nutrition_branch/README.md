# Nutrition Analysis via PDF

This project is designed to analyze dietary and health information extracted from PDFs. It uses custom AI agents and tasks to extract, process, and summarize nutritional data. The app integrates various AI functionalities using Python, and dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.

## Files in the Repository

### 1. `agents.py`
Defines custom agents for AI tasks, such as:
   - PDF Agent: Extracts and summarizes meaningful content from a PDF.
   - Writer Task: Analyzes and summarizes dietary information.
   - Nutrition Analysis Agent: Analyzes dietary information and provides actionable recommendations.

### 2. `tasks.py`
Contains custom tasks linked to agents:
   - PDF Task: Extracts nutritional information from a PDF file.
   - Writer Agent: Summarizes extracted information.
   - Nutrition Analysis Task: Provides a detailed breakdown of calories, macro- and micronutrients, and dietary recommendations.
